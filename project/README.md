# Tame of Thrones (Geektrust)

The project is my solution of the [Tame of Thrones](https://www.geektrust.in/coding-problem/backend/tame-of-thrones) problem given by Geek Trust.

## Problem Statement

Shan, the gorilla king of the Space kingdom wants to rule all Six Kingdoms in the universe of Southeros.

There is no ruler today and pandemonium reigns. Shan is sending secret messages to all kingdoms to ask for their allegiance. Your coding challenge is to help King Shan send the right message to the right kingdom to win them over. Each kingdom has their own emblem and the secret message should contain the letters of the emblem in it. Once Shan has the support of 3 other kingdoms, he is the ruler!

Input needs to be read from a text file, and output should be printed to console. Your program should execute and take the location to the test file as parameter.
